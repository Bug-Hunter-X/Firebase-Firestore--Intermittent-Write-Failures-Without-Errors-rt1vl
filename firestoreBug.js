In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't being written to the Firestore database despite seemingly correct code and authentication. The write operation wouldn't throw any errors, and the client-side code would indicate success, but the data wouldn't appear in Firestore.  This behavior was intermittent, making it even more difficult to debug.
