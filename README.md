# Firebase Firestore Intermittent Write Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase Firestore where write operations sometimes fail silently.  The client-side code executes successfully, but the data is not written to the database. This issue is intermittent, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Description

The problem involves a seemingly correct Firestore write operation that, intermittently, fails without any error messages. The application's client-side code (JavaScript, in this example) indicates success, but the data is not reflected in the Firestore database.

## Solution

A potential solution involves more robust error handling and potentially checking server-side responses for discrepancies.  The provided solution includes improved logging and a retry mechanism.
